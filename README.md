Jupyter Notebooks with Docker on Windows 7  
==========================================
Abstract:
```
Although Jupyter Notebooks are the de facto standard for data science to document
and develop Machine Learning processes, it still requires a significant amount of
work to install the required software on a local machine.  As requirements change
you may be required to add or remove existing software, creating dependency issues.
If you use a variety of tool chains this issue can become quite pronounced.  

In this presentation will show how to run Jupyter Notebooks locally on Windows 7
using docker pre-configured containers to avoid the dependencies issues, promote
sharing within a team, and speed development.
