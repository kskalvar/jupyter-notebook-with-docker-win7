Jupyter Notebooks with Docker on Windows 7  
==========================================
Abstract:
```
Although Jupyter Notebooks are the defacto standard for data science to document and develop Machine Learning
processes, it still requires a significant amount of work to install the required software on a local
machine.  As requiremnts change it may be required to add or remove existing software or create dependency issues.

In this presentation will show how to run Jupyter Notebooks locally on Windows 7 using docker pre-confgiured
containers to avoid the dependencies issues, promote sharing within a team, and speed development.
